Navigation with the keyboard and screen reader have to both work properly at the same time. In order for this to happen, you need to use the correct ARIA attributes and to map them to their HTML counterparts.

Screen readers offer list features, that ease the app navigation, by grouping and extracting all elements with similar behaviors. This leads to additional requirements when creating OpenUI5 controls. Control developers need to make sure that their controls are marked with the correct ARIA role.

Tooltips and semantic colors are important aspects in apps. They have to be interpreted correctly by the screen reader and require some special ARIA labeling.
-   **[ARIA Event Handling](ARIA_Event_Handling_79a9c51.md "When the UI of an application is changing or loading information, these state

When the UI of an application is changing or loading information, these state transitions and updates need to be passed on to the screen reader as well. You need to set the correct ARIA attributes \(for example, aria-live or aria-busy\) for the corresponding areas in your application.

Proper labeling of all UI elements is needed in order to ensure the screen reader announces everything correctly. Here we describe the available options and how and when they should be used.
