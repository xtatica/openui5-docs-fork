**Reminder: Outdated OpenUI5 Versions to Be Removed from the CDN**

For security reasons, OpenUI5 versions that are no longer maintained will be removed from the UI5 content delivery network \(CDN\) one year after their end of maintenance. If a version is still in maintenance, patches of that version that are older than one year will also be removed. We have noted that a number of customers are still using such outdated versions or patches. If this affects you, please note that once these versions or patches are removed, your applications will break. Please update to a more recent version or patch. For more information, see: [Removing Outdated UI5 Versions from UI5 CDN](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/01/26/removing-outdated-ui5-versions-from-ui5-cdn/) as well as the UI5 notifications in the Demo Kit.

### Improved Features


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**Drag and Drop**

We have now enabled drag and drop for use on mobile devices for iOS 15.1 and higher releases and the latest Chrome 98 for Android.

> ### Note:  
> The availability of drag and drop depends on whether the respective browser supports drag and drop.

For more information, see [Drag and Drop](Drag_and_Drop_3ddb6cd.md).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**High Contrast Themes**

We have prevented the overwriting of the high contrast setting of Windows for all OpenUI5 themes when using Chrome and Edge browsers.



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V2 Model**

The new `sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context#delete` method deletes a binding's `Context` irrespective of its status, including inactive, transient, and persisted contexts.For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context%23methods/delete).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   We now support the setting of a different binding context for a relative list binding with transient contexts.

-   `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper#format` now evaluates the `com.sap.vocabularies.common.v1.Timezone` annotation of properties of the `Edm.DateTimeOffset` type. A composite binding with an `sap.ui.model.odata.type.DateTimeWithTimezone` type is generated, showing the date/time and the time zone. For more information, see [AnnotationHelper](Meta_Model_for_OData_V4_7f29fb3.md#loio7f29fb3ce5964d8090038a9d3cdf5060__section_AnnoHelp).

-   We provide a new sample application that demonstrates how data in different controls can be kept in sync. The application also shows important aspects of consuming a draft-enabled back-end service.For more information, see the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataModel/sample/sap.ui.core.sample.odata.v4.Draft).

### Improved Controls


<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.List, sap.m.Table, sap.m.Tree`**

For better user experience with a more visual approach and a more conversational tone, these tables can now use another control, for example, the `sap.m.IllustratedMessage` control, based on the new `noData` aggregation. This control can be used if no data is available for a table. For more information, see the [API Reference for the `noData` aggregation](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.ListBase) and the [API Reference for `IllustratedMessage`](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.IllustratedMessage). 



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.upload.UploadSet`**

You can now sort, group, and filter the items within `UploadSet`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.upload.UploadSet) and the [Samples](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.upload.UploadSet).



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

**`sap.m.Wizard`**

-   We have introduced the `navigationChange` event. It is fired when the current visible step is changed by either tapping on the `sap.m.WizardProgressNavigator` or scrolling through the steps. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.Wizard) and the [Sample](https://sdk.openui5.org/entity/sap.m.Wizard/sample/sap.m.sample.WizardSingleStep). 

-   We have also removed the experimental flag for the `sap.m.WizardRenderMode` property. For more information, see the [API Reference](https://sdk.openui5.org/api/sap.m.WizardRenderMode).
